                                Parentsâ€™ jobs in educating their children can be ease by the help of a learning tool. 
                                According to (Blair & Shawler, 2020), educators and trainers can incorporate these methods and learning tools into their current curriculum and instructional designs to improve overall learning outcomes and training efficiency.
                                One of the methods includes in the learning tool is automatic recognition speech (ASR). ASR has been helpful in improving the speech modelling for the speech learning tool.
                                For decades, researchers and teachers have proposed ways to use technology to teach and learn pronunciation, and there are numerous useful tools available for this purpose (Yoshida & Tritch, 2018). Hence, this project aims to help the parents in 
                                educating their children by the help of ASR tool.

                                    This project aims to help parents teach their kids on how to speak certain words. For example on this project,
                                    our goal is to teach the kids words about nature such as lightning, rain, storm, ocean, and tree. As a kid they 
                                    need to take a baby step in learning new things so we teach them a very simple words first and later after they 
                                    already know how to learn all these simple words then later they can step up their speech lesson.
