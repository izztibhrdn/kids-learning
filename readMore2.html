Since the school had to close the job of educating the children is on the parents. Based on (Lederman, 2020), without notice, parents were thrust into a new position as "teachers" for their children and organisers of free time activities from one day to the next. Having said that, an online learning tool can help all those parents in home-schooling their children and lessen their works. Learning tool can help those children to learn by themselves without having to go to school. Their parents can assist them while using the tools online to avoid the children from using any inappropriate website.  
 A web-based learning tool also has several advantages such as tool can be made available from any location and any time. Other than that, it can be an efficient way of delivering course material. E-learning significantly reduced administrative effort, such as preparation and recording of lectures, attendance, and leaving classes. Teachers and students alike recognise that online learning methods encourage students to pursue lessons from anywhere and in difficult circumstances that prevent them from attending universities and schools (Maatuk, Elberkawi, Aljawarneh, Rashaideh, & Alharbi, 2021). With the help of this kind of learning tools, parents can do their house chores while leave the teaching job to the learning tool. 
 On the account, in this project, we will develop a web-based application as a tool for the user to learn new things. We hope that the web-based application can make the kids learn new things.
