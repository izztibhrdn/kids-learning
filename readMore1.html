 Since this Covid-19 pandemic, people are getting busier for new life routine. Some people don’t even go outside their house to prevent the spread of the virus. As a responsible citizen, we need to take part in order to help the decrease of the daily cases in our country. Nowadays, people just doing their work from home and for some people they like it more this way. While on the other hand, some people would not love this idea of working from home because the stress level would be double than before especially parents. Parents with children at the very young age are probably the most stressful ones because they need to take care of their kids while working. Children needs parents around them, to provide support with homework when necessary and promote a positive development and new learning experiences for toddlers and pre-schoolers (Spinelli, Lionetti, Pastore, & Fasolo, 2020). In addition, kids around the age of 1 to 4 years old need to learn basic vocabulary from their parent in order to make them able to speak fluently when they entering primary school. Parents have been left alone not only in taking care of home-schooling their children, but also in general in managing their children and of the home environment.  
 Recent cross-country assessments of basic reading and numeracy abilities among primary and middle-school children in India have shown numerous troubling facts, such as the low number of kids who can even achieve grade-level standards (Sabu, Swarup, Tulsiani, & Rao, 2017). Your child's vocabulary rapidly grows between the ages of 2-3 years. They could even pick up new words every day. In general, youngster comprehends more words than they can articulate and parents need to focus on teaching their child on how to speak and learn new speech. Working parents might not have enough time to give full attention towards their child and might lose the chance to teach them how to speak fluently. Researchers have investigated how children's speech patterns differ from those of adults (Shivakumar & Georgiou, 2020). 
Parents’ jobs in educating their children can be ease by the help of a learning tool. According to (Blair & Shawler, 2020), educators and trainers can incorporate these methods and learning tools into their current curriculum and instructional designs to improve overall learning outcomes and training efficiency. One of the methods includes in the learning tool is automatic recognition speech (ASR). ASR has been helpful in improving the speech modelling for the speech learning tool. For decades, researchers and teachers have proposed ways to use technology to teach and learn pronunciation, and there are numerous useful tools available for this purpose (Yoshida & Tritch, 2018). Hence, this project aims to help the parents in educating their children by the help of ASR tool.
